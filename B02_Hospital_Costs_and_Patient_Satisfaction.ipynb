        "# Problem Definition\n",
        "This project aims to help hospital administrators, policymakers, and insurance payers understand how spending and patient experience relate across U.S. hospitals. By analyzing the relationship between hospital costs and patient satisfaction, we can identify whether higher spending actually translates into better outcomes and which regions or hospitals deliver the best value. The goal is to uncover patterns that support more efficient healthcare resource allocation and highlight potential performance gaps across states or hospital systems. Success is defined as producing clear, SQL-based evidence that reveals meaningful differences in cost, satisfaction, and value across hospitals."

        "# Introduction & Motivation\n",
        "Hospitals in the U.S. are getting more expensive every year, but patients aren’t necessarily feeling more satisfied. So the real question is: are we paying for better care, or just paying more?\n",
        "Our analysis looks at nationwide hospital cost and satisfaction data to find out whether higher spending actually leads to better patient experiences, and which states or hospitals deliver the best value for the money. This matters for hospital leaders, policymakers, and insurers who want to understand where money is being used effectively—and where it isn’t."

        "\n",
        "At the outset of this project, our goal was to understand the relationship between hospital costs and patient satisfaction across the United States. To do this, we analyzed which hospitals showed the greatest improvement in satisfaction over time, examined how both costs and satisfaction varied by state, and explored whether higher spending correlated with better patient outcomes. Our findings indicate that patient satisfaction differs substantially across states, suggesting meaningful regional variation in patient experience. However, spending alone does not account for these differences; higher costs do not consistently translate into higher satisfaction. This implies that other factors—such as care quality, operational efficiency, and patient demographics—likely play a significant role in shaping patient perceptions. Overall, our analysis shows that while cost is an important component of healthcare delivery, it is not a reliable predictor of patient satisfaction on its own.\n",

Their scores went up by almost 100 points. These hospitals are in smaller cities like Columbia and Mount Vernon. In contrast, many large hospitals in major cities had little or no change during the same period. Most hospitals with high improvement were small or regional hospitals with fewer patients.\n",

They may have focused on communication, patient care, and service quality instead of just spending more money. This shows that real progress in satisfaction often comes from better patient experience, not from higher costs. Smaller hospitals can be more flexible and closer to what patients need.\n",

The value-indexes range from 2.9047604005597347 to 1.8064283589538719, suggesting that there are still significant differences within the top decile.

        "Because an increase in price leads to an decrease in value-index score, it means that there is either a redundantly circular relation between price and satisfaction, or there is a different variable that was not considered such as hospital size. As previously mentioned, hospital size may be one such candidate as smaller hospitals may be able to lower operating costs and provide personalized care in ways that are not scaleable to larger hospitals. Any further research should aim to clarify this relationship as well as explore other seemingly unrelated variables."

In contrast, the lowest-severity group has the lowest costs but the highest satisfaction, suggesting that tougher cases do not lead to better perceived care. The value delivered per $1,000 spent drops substantially in high-severity hospitals—almost half of that in the lowest tier. Overall, higher costs reflect treating more difficult cases rather than delivering higher-quality patient experience."

        "Several conclusions in EDA questions suggests that higher costs does not equate to higher patient satisfaction or higher value in care. In fact, higher costs often led to lower patient perceptions of care value. Whether examined across time or location, it held true that cost and satisfaction moved independently when examining all of the hospital within the dataset.\n",

        "Smaller regional hospital such as Citizens Medical Center, Oklahoma Heart Hospital, Caldwell Memorial Hospital, and Rockcastle consistently demonstrated high levels of care for lower costs; suggesting that high value-index care is a repeatable process. Whether or not it can be scaled for larger hospitals remains unclear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis on the state level showed that there were little differences in care quality within the different cost tiers. Meanwhile, the overall correlation between cost and satisfaction (r ≈ 0.0004) confirms the idea that care can be provided at afforable costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps of this project should aim to cover the project shortcomings. For example, treatment for different illnesses were compared on equal footing. A treatment method that has a low success rate and high price could be compared to one that is generally low-price and successful. It could mimic the cost-value dynamic that has been demonstrated due to the nature of these treatments rather than how well these hospitals care for patients. Another goal for future research could be the further exploration between the relationship between care quality, treatment cost, and hospital size.\n",

        "One of the biggest challenges we faced was that the datasets didn’t line up at the same level of detail. The cost table had one row per hospital per year, but the satisfaction data had multiple responses for the same hospital. At first this caused messy joins and unstable averages, so we had to aggregate the survey data up to the facility-year level before doing any comparisons. We also didn’t have true patient volume data, so we had to rely on proxies like response_count or star_rating, which isn’t ideal but was the only workable option.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge was that the data wasn’t evenly distributed across states—some states had plenty of hospitals and others barely had enough to compute a reliable average. To avoid misleading results, we set minimum record thresholds and used NTILE grouping to balance comparisons. We also checked for outliers using simple z-score logic (even though it’s slightly beyond what we formally learned), because the payment amounts had extreme values that could easily skew our results. After adjusting for these issues, the cleaned data became much more consistent and trustworthy for analysis.\n"
